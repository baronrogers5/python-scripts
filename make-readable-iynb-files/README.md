# Clean Unreadable IPYNB Files

Some ipynb files when opened via a text editor are almost impossible to read because of poor formatting, this script accepts various paths to ipynb files (irrespective of folders) and makes corrected files in the respective folder.

To run:
```bash
$ python3 clean_unreadable_ipynb_files.py -f <path-to-file1> <path-to-file2>
```

Output is files with name appended with *corrected*
